# d-hessian
HessianD is an implementation of the Hessian Protocol (http://caucho.com/hessian), a binary webservice protocol, in the D programming language. Some of the high lights of this protocol are lightweight, self descriptor and a relatively complete set of data types including objects, maps and vectors.

In this regard this implementation tries to support most of the D language data types including user defined ones (classes and structs).
